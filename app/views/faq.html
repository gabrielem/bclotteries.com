    </div>
    <div class="a" id="a-2">
      At BlockChain Lotteries we do not run software internally to calculate your bet results:
      you are betting directly on the last digits of the Bitcoin Blockchain future Nonce numbers.<br>
      When you send bitcoin to one of our Bet Address to place a bet, in few minutes your transaction will
      get included in a Block by the Bitcoin Miners Network (this happen when your transaction shows "1 Confirmation").
      At this moment we take the Block where your Bet Transaction is included and use its unique Nonce number last digit
      (Lottery 9) or last 2 digits (Lottery 99) or last 3 digits (Lottery 999) as your bet result.<br>If you guessed the
      right Nonce result BlockChain Lotteries will immediately payout the won amount to the same Bitcoin address we
      received the bet from.

      All Invalid Bets will NOT be displayed in the Bet section and will be returned to the sender’s address after the invalid Bet Transaction has reached 6 Confirmations from the Bitcoin Network.

    </div>
    <div class="a" id="in-3">
      Be sure to add network fees in your bet transaction!
      <br>
      We strongly recommend players to send network fees sufficient to ensure all mining pool operators will accept the transaction (currently 0.0002 Btc per KB).
      <br>
      Not including Network Fees to your Bet Transaction could result in late transaction processing by the Bitcoin Network. In simple words your Bet Transaction could not be included in the next available block, hence your Bet Result (that is based on the Nonce of the Block where your Bet Transaction is included) could be delayed by several hours.
